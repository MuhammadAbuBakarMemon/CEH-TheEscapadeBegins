Evading refers to bypass something
with one technique we can bypass Firewall (FW), IPS, and Honeypots
because all of these have the same functionality

They are bypassed via the Nmap tool

Honeypots are traps created for attackers so that we can monitor the activities of an attacker
The attackers comes to deliver an intrusion attempt on our newtwork but in turns ends up giving us their details as
our firewall directs the intruder to a parallel network to ours instead of our original network (the honeypot)
We do this by developing/constructing an identical network to our network in parallel
It can be used to get information about how cybercriminals operate and think 
These attempts made by the attcaker are termed as intrusion attempts

Port 80 is the port that allows data sharing under http////
Port 23 is the port for TELNET (which we use yo obtian the access of any machine)

Firewall is a software that is used for filtering and acts as a gatekeeper, monitoring and controlling IP
ACL (Access Control List) are the set of rules that re used by the firewall to givern network traffic

Sangfot is a cheaper hardware firewall manufactures, 
Cisco is the most expensive firewall manufacturer,

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

Previously we used to have a Firewall IPS and IDS all seperate
Now we have all modules [(Firewall), (IPS), (IDS)] fitted in one device named NextGenerationFirewall (NGFW), which
is one device which has all of them, but a seperate license has to be purchased for every module, and all 3 modules work 
together

IPS and IDS work on signatures that contain the latest data against every other attack, previously 
signatures had to be updated every 15 days when the manufactures released an to update the firewall, but now 
CISCO now has shifted to CloudTelos a cloud based way through which signatures that contain preventions from several latest 
and updated attacks in real time, and network engineers in organisations do not have to give the IPS Server a downtime and 
then update signatures locally and then upload them to the IPS Server

IPS and IDS capture and detect attacks from outside the network they show us the visibility of IP's that are attacking 
the network, without these two if we only have a firewall then it will prevent attacks but we won't be able to have the IP of 
the intruder trying to invade our network 


nmap --iflist 
used to for figuring out the eht0 (the interface name of our computer)
lo = loopback 
used for selftesting

Stealth Scanning 

nmap-sS-p445-e eth0(interface name) -S 10.0.0.1 192.16.4.76
nmap -sS = stealthScan (stealing)
-e eth0 (interface name) 
-S Spoof IP
then we add the IP address that we want to attack

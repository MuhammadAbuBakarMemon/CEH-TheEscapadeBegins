Evading refers to bypass something
with one technique we can bypass Firewall (FW), IPS, and Honeypots
because all of these have the same functionality

They are bypassed via the Nmap tool

Honeypots are traps created for attackers so that we can monitor the activities of an attacker
The attackers comes to deliver an intrusion attempt on our newtwork but in turns ends up giving us their details as
our firewall directs the intruder to a parallel network to ours instead of our original network (the honeypot)
We do this by developing/constructing an identical network to our network in parallel
It can be used to get information about how cybercriminals operate and think 
These attempts made by the attcaker are termed as intrusion attempts

Port 80 is the port that allows data sharing under http////
Port 23 is the port for TELNET (which we use yo obtian the access of any machine)

Firewall is a software that is used for filtering and acts as a gatekeeper, monitoring and controlling IP
